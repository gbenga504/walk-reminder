## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Chrome Extension API: Leveraging alarms, notifications, storage, and offscreen APIs for core functionality.

- React: For building an interactive and user-friendly popup interface.

- Service Worker (background.js): Handles the main logic, alarm scheduling, and communication.

- Offscreen Document (offscreen.html, offscreen.js): A hidden HTML page used specifically for playing audio, as service workers do not have direct DOM access.

- Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern styling of the popup UI.
